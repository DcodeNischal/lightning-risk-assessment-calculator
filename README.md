## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
├── core/           # Constants, utilities, helpers
├── data/           # Data models
├── domain/         # Business logic (calculators, services)
└── presentation/   # UI components (screens, widgets)
```

For detailed architecture documentation, see [REFACTORING_GUIDE.md](REFACTORING_GUIDE.md).

### Example Calculation

```dart
import 'package:lightning_risk_assessment/domain/services/risk_calculator_service.dart';
import 'package:lightning_risk_assessment/data/models/zone_parameters.dart';

// Create parameters
final params = ZoneParameters(
  length: 15.0,
  width: 20.0,
  height: 6.0,
  locationFactorKey: 'Isolated Structure (Within a distance of 3H)',
  lightningFlashDensity: 8.0,
  environmentalFactorKey: 'Rural',
  // ... other parameters
);

// Calculate risk
final service = RiskCalculatorService();
final result = await service.calculateRisk(params);

// Check results
print('R1 (Loss of human life): ${result.formattedR1}');
print('Protection required: ${result.protectionRequired}');
print('Protection level: ${result.protectionLevel}');
```

- **AI**: Flashes near incoming lines
- **ADJ**: Flashes to adjacent structure

#### Number of Dangerous Events
- **ND**: Flashes to structure
- **NM**: Flashes near structure
- **NL**: Flashes to lines
- **NI**: Flashes near lines
- **NDJ**: Flashes to adjacent structure

#### Probability of Damage
- **PA**: Injury to living beings (structure)
- **PB**: Physical damage (structure)
- **PC**: System failure (structure)
- **PM**: System failure (near structure)
- **PU**: Injury to living beings (lines)
- **PV**: Physical damage (lines)
- **PW**: System failure (lines)
- **PZ**: System failure (near lines)

#### Risk Components
- **RA**: Risk of injury (structure)
- **RB**: Risk of physical damage (structure)
- **RC**: Risk of system failure (structure)
- **RM**: Risk of system failure (near structure)
- **RU**: Risk of injury (lines)
- **RV**: Risk of physical damage (lines)
- **RW**: Risk of system failure (lines)
- **RZ**: Risk of system failure (near lines)

#### Total Risks
- **R1**: Loss of human life
