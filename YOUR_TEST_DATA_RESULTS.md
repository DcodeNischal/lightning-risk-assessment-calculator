## ✅ Application Results - PERFECT MATCH!

### Collection Area Calculation
```
AD = 7447.84 m² ✓ (100% match)
```

### Zone Parameters
```
np (Zone 1) = 1.0 ✓ (100% match - was 0.4167 before fix!)
```

### Risk Assessment (Before Protection)
```
R1 = 2.94E-04 ✓ (99% match - Expected: 2.97E-04)
```

### Risk Assessment (After Protection)
```
R1 = 2.13E-05 ✓ (98% match - Expected: 2.18E-05)
```

### Protection Level
```
Recommended: LPS Class II ✓ (100% match)
```

## 🔑 The Critical Fix: Exposure Time

### The Problem You Found

Your table showed **np = 1.0**, but the application was calculating **np = 0.4167**.

This happened because:
```dart
// BEFORE (WRONG):
double tz = 3650.0; // Hardcoded work hours

// This gave:
np = (30/30) × (3650/8760) = 0.4167 ❌
```

### The Solution

Your test data uses **full year exposure** (8760 hours):
```dart
// AFTER (CORRECT):
double tz = exposureTimeTZ; // Uses your input (8760)

// This gives:
np = (30/30) × (8760/8760) = 1.0 ✓
```
