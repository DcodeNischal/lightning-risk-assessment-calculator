### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Requiring Fine-Tuning

#### 1. R1 (Loss of Human Life) - CRITICAL ISSUE
- **Current**: 1.99e-2
- **Expected**: 2.97e-04
- **Problem**: R1 is 67x too large
- **Root Cause**: R1 and R2 are IDENTICAL (both 1.99e-2)
  - This indicates R1 is including components that should only be in R2
  - Since R2 value is close to correct, the issue is in R1 component selection

#### 2. R2 (Loss of Public Service)
- **Current Before**: 1.99e-2
- **Expected**: 1.76e-02
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Very close! (within 13%)
- **Current After**: 9.97e-4
- **Expected After**: 1.76e-02
- **Problem**: After-protection reduction is too aggressive (20x instead of ~2x)

#### 3. R4 (Loss of Economic Value)
- **Current Before**: 1.44e-1
- **Expected**: 6.48e-02
- **Problem**: 2.2x too large
- **Current After**: 7.18e-3
- **Expected After**: 6.35e-02
- **Problem**: After-protection reduction is too aggressive (20x instead of ~2x)

#### 4. Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **CPM**: 1.15 million ‚úÖ (PERFECT!)
- **CL**: 28.71 million (Expected: ~13.00) - 2.2x too large
- **CRL**: 1.44 million (Expected: ~12.70) - 11x too small
- **SM**: 26.13 million (Expected: -0.89) - Wrong sign/value
- **Note**: CL and CRL discrepancies are due to R4 being incorrect

### üîç Key Findings

1. **X Factor**: Not the primary issue. Removed from RC1, RM1, RW1, RZ1 calculations.

2. **Loss Factors**: 
   - LC1 (R1 internal systems) = LO1 * np = 0.001 * 0.4167
   - LC2 (R2 internal systems) = LO2 * np = 0.001 * 0.4167
   - They are IDENTICAL because LO1='LO(Others)'=0.001 and LO2='TV, telecommunication'=0.001

3. **Zone Time**: Fixed to 3650 hours (was using 8760), giving correct np=0.4167

4. **Economic Values**: Fixed to use cb=75, cc=10, cs=15, giving sp=1.0

### üìã Next Steps to Complete Fine-Tuning

1. **PRIORITY 1**: Investigate why R1 and R2 are identical
   - Review which risk components should contribute to R1 vs R2
   - Verify component calculations (RA1, RB1, RC1, etc.)
   - Check if certain components should be excluded from R1

2. **PRIORITY 2**: Fix after-protection calculations
   - Currently reducing risks by 20x (9.97e-4 / 1.99e-2)
   - Should reduce by ~2-10x based on protection measures
   - Review `calculateRisksAfterProtection` method

3. **PRIORITY 3**: Fine-tune R4 calculations
   - Currently 2.2x too large
   - May be related to economic value factors or loss calculations

4. **PRIORITY 4**: Validate cost-benefit analysis
   - Should automatically correct once R4 is fixed
